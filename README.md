# Language Tandem
 An application that enables users to find their language learning partner around the world

## Background
Last week, I attended MLH's LHD:Share. This is one of MLH's major programming events where one can learn how to build different projects, and as a person who likes coding, I am so thankful that MLH still continues organizing it. This project is created whilst following Mayan's "Mobile Development track". It is a social networking app that allows one to find partners to learn languages with.
